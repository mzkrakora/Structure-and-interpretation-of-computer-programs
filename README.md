# Structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs
Introduction to computer science course at UC Berkeley. Focusing on managing complexity, mastering abstraction, and programming paradigms. The course specifically focuses on python fundamentals, combining mutliple ideas into large projects, and how computers interpret programming languages. Other languages are taught in addition to python. 

In this project, I develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog, using control statements and higher-order functions. 

The project contains files for the game implementation, the dice, and a graphical user interface.
