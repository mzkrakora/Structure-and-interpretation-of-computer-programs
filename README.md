# Structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs
Introduction to computer science course at UC Berkeley. Focusing on managing complexity, mastering abstraction, and programming paradigms. The course specifically focuses on python fundamentals, combining mutliple ideas into large projects, and how computers interpret programming languages. Other languages are taught in addition to python. 

Hog Project: Deveop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. I used control statements and higher order functions together. The project includes implementation of the game Hog, functions for dice rolling, and a graphical user interface. 

Maps Project: In this project, I created a visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. 

Ants Project: In this project, I created a tower defense game called Ants vs. Some Bees. This project combined functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.
